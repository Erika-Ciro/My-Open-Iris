# My-Open-Iris

**Open the iris!**

A common mistake businesses make is to assume machine learning is magic, so it's okay to skip thinking about what it means to do the task well.

# Introduction
Time do to an end-to-end project in data science. which means:

1. Loading the dataset.
2. Summarizing the dataset.
3. Visualizing the dataset.
4. Evaluating some algorithms.
5. Making some predictions.
6. A must-see example of data science is the iris dataset. We will predict which class of iris plant a plant belongs to based on its characteristics.

***Iris versicolor - Iris setosa - Iris virginica***

# Where to get started?
Environment. We will use Jupyter.

In Data Science, the winning combo is pandas (and/or numpy), matplotlib, sklearn (and/or keras).
In this project, we will use:

- pandas to load the data
- matplotlib to do the visualization
- sklearn to do the prediction
